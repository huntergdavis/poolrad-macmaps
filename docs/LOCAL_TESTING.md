# Local Android prototype

## Build

Use JDK 17, Android SDK 34, build-tools 34.0.0, and NDK 27.0.12077973.
From `android/`:

```sh
./gradlew :minivmac:assembleMacIIDebug :minivmac:testMacIIDebugUnitTest
```

Set `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` to the local installations if necessary.
Normal builds produce debug-signed APKs in
`android/minivmac/build/outputs/apk/macII/debug/`, including ARM64 and universal
variants. Debug signing is suitable for this prototype; keep the same personal
key for future updates. Release signing is not configured.

For faster **local x86_64 emulator testing**, add
`-Pandroid.injected.build.abi=x86_64`. That IDE-style build instead writes to
`build/intermediates/apk/macII/debug/`, is marked test-only, and requires
`adb install -t`. Do not hand that APK to an ARM tablet.

The `macPlus` flavor builds separately and requires a matching Plus ROM. The
supplied 256 KiB Mac II ROM is not a substitute. The tested local app ID is
`com.hunterdavis.poolradmacmaps.ii`; neither flavor replaces the stock app.

## Test inputs

Never mount the original supplied disks for testing. ROMs, images, saves,
extracted resource forks, screenshots, and RAM stay in ignored `scratch/`.
The app uses private internal storage for disks/ROMs/cache and disables cloud
backup. Regular imports use the upstream Android file picker.

On this workstation, the AOSP API 30 emulator `poolrad-map-test` runs on
`emulator-5580`, at 1200×1600 and density 200. It has booted copies of
`MacII.ROM`, `MinivMacBootv2.dsk`, and an HFS disk made from the supplied game
archive. This does not verify the physical tablet's e-ink refresh behavior.

### Resource-fork-safe test disk

Install `unar` and `hfsutils`. Extract privately:

```sh
unar -q -s -k visible -o scratch/extracted scratch/input/Pool_Of_Radiance.SIT
node tools/prepare-test-game.mjs 'scratch/extracted/Pool Of Radiance' scratch/test-disks/NEW-game.dsk
```

The helper refuses an existing destination, wraps the extracted data/resource
forks in MacBinary II, then delegates HFS creation/copying to `hfsutils`. It
does not ship game data or implement HFS. The game application has an empty
data fork and a 327,595-byte resource fork; losing that fork makes it unlaunchable.

**Known input issue:** `unar` reported an extraction error for
`PoolRad2/ITEM2.DAX`. All eight GEO files decode; the game boots and its sample
party loads, but this is not proof that every encounter/item file is healthy.

## Code wheel

Use **PoolRad → Code wheel lookup**. Select an outer Espruar rune, an inner
Dethek rune, and the dotted/dash-dot/dashed path. **Enter code** sends normal
guest key events, including Return. It does not bypass or patch game code.
Use the action at the game's code-word prompt; it does not yet detect the
prompt or identify its runes automatically. Closing the lookup sends nothing.
App pause cancels a pending entry and releases any held helper key.

Rune numbering matches the reading order of the linked reference. Its 72
illustrations are an opt-in HTTPS download from `dkennedy.io`, cached privately.
No game state is sent. If unavailable, the numbered lookup still works; partial
downloads resume on retry. The arithmetic and answer table never need a network.
The linked table spells one entry `80ASIS` (with a zero); we preserve it instead
of silently changing the requested reference. That particular answer remains
unverified in-game. A leading wheel alignment digit is omitted when typing.

## Map discovery, not live tracking yet

### Completed smoke checks (2026-09-13)

- All four configured Mac II ABIs built, with a normal universal APK.
- 18 JUnit tests passed (13 map-parser tests, 5 wheel tests).
- All 29 local maps parsed; every cell/direction lookup exercised.
- Actual game boot, code-wheel answer, and sample-party load succeeded.
- Private RAM snapshots captured while the game remained running.
- The native rune download cached all 72 illustrations; glyphs and lookup worked
  with the test emulator's Wi-Fi and mobile data disabled.
- Native **Enter code** selected 21/14/dashes → `WYVERN`, typed it, pressed
  Return, and passed the actual Mac game's startup check. No external key event
  supplied the Return in that test.

The checked screenshots live only in `scratch/`. `tools/android-ui.mjs` selects
host controls by fresh accessibility labels, avoiding timing-sensitive taps.
It requires an explicit emulator serial and refuses physical-device targets.

### Remaining map work

Debug **PoolRad → Capture RAM** copies RAM between CPU ticks, then writes the
copy on a worker thread to private `files/snapshots/`. No native RAM pointer is
read from the UI thread. On the tested 8 MiB Mac II, captures are 8,388,608 bytes.
Pull snapshots only from the local test app using `adb exec-out run-as`; never
commit them or put them in an APK.

`tools/InspectMaps.java` and `tools/InspectRam.java` use the same Java DAX/GEO
decoder as the app. Compile with the mapper classes to a directory in scratch.
The latter finds geometry candidates, **not** confirmed active-map pointers.

Two labeled captures show the game reporting `15,1 W`, then `11,2 S` during its
opening tour. Map 0 wall data matched at `0x71d9e8`; one adjacent byte X/Y
candidate changed correctly at `0x7677ba`. The following byte changed `6 → 4`,
which is a facing candidate. These are discovery observations from one run,
**not hard-coded tracking addresses**. Rotation, blocked movement, transitions,
relocation after restart, and non-exploration states still need validation.
